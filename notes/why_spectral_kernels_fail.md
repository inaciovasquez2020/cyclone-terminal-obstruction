Smooth translation-invariant spectral kernels admit a high-frequency escape route.
On the torus, a kernel with Fourier symbol Khat(2πm) decreasing to 0 as |m|→∞ cannot satisfy a Cyclone-type uniform lower bound on the mean-zero subspace.
Choosing f as a highest-frequency Fourier mode yields ⟨f,Kf⟩ arbitrarily small with ‖f‖₂=1 and mean zero.
Therefore any Cyclone kernel must block high-frequency escape by discrete locality, bounded pattern type space, or a non-spectral rigidity mechanism.
