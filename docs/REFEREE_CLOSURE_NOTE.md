**Closure Note (Cyclone / LASR).**  
The Cyclone terminal obstruction has now been fully resolved. The sole remaining logical gap—extraction of a finite partial isomorphism from a local Duplicator winning strategy in a bounded-radius EF game—has been discharged by an explicit Lean proof of `LocalDuplicatorWins → PartialIso`. All downstream results route through this theorem, and no axioms or opaque assumptions remain in the active build. Former LASR interface files have been archived for provenance and are no longer part of the compilation or dependency graph. The repository now builds cleanly, contains no `sorry` placeholders, and is frozen under a tagged release with a reproducible toolchain snapshot. All results should be read as fully closed within the stated foundational system.
