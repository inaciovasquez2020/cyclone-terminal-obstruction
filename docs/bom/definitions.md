orank(C) over F2
Let E = {e1,...,em} be a fixed edge order.
For a simple cycle C, define 1_C in F2^m by (1_C)i = 1[ei in C].
For a family of cycles C = {C1,...,Cs}, define M_C in F2^{s x m} by rows 1_Cj.
Define orank(C) = rank_F2(M_C).
cycle-expander (Delta,h)
A graph G=(V,E) with max degree <= Delta is a (Delta,h)-edge-expander if
for all S subset V with 1 <= |S| <= |V|/2 we have |∂S| >= h |S|.
