\paragraph{Step 5: Contradiction.}
This contradicts $\dim \rho_{v^\dagger}(\mathcal C(G))\le c$.
Therefore $T\le c$, and the set $W$ has size at most $c$, completing the proof.
\qed

\subsection{Remarks}
All steps except the transport in Step~4 are elementary linear algebra.
Step~4 is precisely the locality--rigidity interface captured by FO$^k_r$-homogeneity.
