AKR CPD1 falsifier template

Goal
Attempt to falsify CPD1 for K_AKR:
find points θ_i and coefficients c_i with Σ c_i = 0 such that
  Σ_{i,j} c_i c_j K_AKR(θ_i,θ_j) < 0.

Required data
- Finite point set {θ_i}
- Coefficients c_i
- Numerical or symbolic evaluation

Expected outcome
No such example exists if proof is correct.

Status
UNFILLED — numerical stress testing placeholder.
