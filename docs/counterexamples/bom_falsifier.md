BOM falsifier template

Goal
Provide a counterexample to the BOM principle:
a bounded-degree cycle-expander G and a cycle family C such that
  orank(C) ≤ B0(k,Δ,h)
but FO^k support compression fails for radius R.

Required data
- Graph G (Δ-bounded, declared expander parameters)
- Cycle family C ⊂ G
- Explicit F2 overlap matrix M_C and rank witness
- EF^k argument or certificate showing no radius-R witness

Status
UNFILLED — placeholder for falsification attempts.
