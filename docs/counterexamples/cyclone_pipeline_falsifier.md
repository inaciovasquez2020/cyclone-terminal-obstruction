Cyclone pipeline falsifier template

Goal
Provide an admissible refinement process P and instance I such that:
- ED(I) is large
- sum_t ΔI(P,I,t) is provably small

This would contradict the Cyclone inequality.

Required data
- Explicit refinement process P
- Transcript / ΔI accounting
- ED lower bound argument

Status
UNFILLED — terminal falsification target.
