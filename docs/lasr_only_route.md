LASR-only Cyclone route

Frozen radius
R*(k,r) = r

Core implication chain
FO^k_r configuration homogeneity
⇒ bounded local cycle-support dimension corank_R*
⇒ overlap-rank bound ovrank_R* ≤ corank_R*^2
⇒ Cyclone bound with B0(Δ,k,r) = C(Δ,k,r)^2

Spectral route is non-authoritative and not part of Cyclone’s public dependency chain.
