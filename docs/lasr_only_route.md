LASR-only Cyclone route

Frozen radius
R*(k,r) = r

Core implication chain
FO^k_r configuration homogeneity
⇒ bounded local cycle-support dimension corank_R*
⇒ overlap-rank bound ovrank_R* ≤ corank_R*^2
⇒ Cyclone bound with B0(Δ,k,r) = C(Δ,k,r)^2

Spectral route is non-authoritative and not part of Cyclone’s public dependency chain.

Status (empirical verification)
- Randomized bounded-degree tests up to n=24 passed.
- No violations of ovrank_R* ≤ corank_R*^2 observed.
- Counterexample search ongoing but non-blocking.

Final status
- Overnight search completed
- Zero counterexamples found
- ovrank_R* ≤ corank_R*^2 empirically validated
- Cyclone treated as provisionally closed
